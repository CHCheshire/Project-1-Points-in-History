                <h4>What is it and why do people play? <i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i></h4>
                <p>Warhammer has several different settings, one based in a very far but very grim future and another based in a more fantasy style universe however both play
                    in a similar way; they are both turn-based tabletop strategy games. A game lasts usually six turns and those turns are split up into several phases where you can do certain actions 
                    based on the phase and units in your army. It's something I got into as a teenager and played for about 4 years but stopped when I went to college however I've now started to get back into the hobby again. 
                    I made a lot of friends from when I played and have a lot of good memories from it as well.  </p>
