        <h1>What is Warhammer?</h1>
        <div id="what-is-left">
            <div class="intro">
                <h3>What is it and why do people play?</h3>
                <p>Warhammer has several different settings, one based in a very far but very grim future and another based in a more fantasy style universe however both play
                    in a similar way; they are both turn-based tabletop strategy games. A game lasts usually six turns and those turns are split up into several phases where you can do certain actions 
                    based on the phase and units in your army. It's something I got into as a teenager and played for about 4 years but stopped when I went to college however I've now started to get back into the hobby again. 
                    I made a lot of friends from when I played and have a lot of good memories from it as well.  </p>
            
            
                <h3>How it's played</h3>
                <p>Warhammer, in either of its systems, follows similar rules to how it's played: You will chose your faction and build an army from that
                    and then you will play the game itself in turns that themselves are split up into phases. So lets look at from the point of view of someone who is just 
                    starting to get into Warhammer 40,000 and wants to build an army, they want to pick a faction that suits their playstyle. One of the reasons that I'm such a big 
                    fan of the game is that you can play in any way you want. Do you want a small, elite force or more of a horde army? Do you want a long ranged army or one that wants
                    to get up close? Do you want a more magic based army or even one designed to counter magic? There a lots of different ways to play and, although some excel more in areas
                    than others, any faction can be played any way, it's simply up to you as a player as to what you want. </p>
                <p> So now that this person has decided on their army, how is the game itself played? You and the other player will set up your armies on either side of the board you're playing on,
                    usually a 6x4 foot map with players set up on opposite long edges of the board. Then you deploy your armies on your respective side and flip a coin to see who goes first. 
                    Whoever wins the toss gets to choose who goes first and then that player will take their first turn. Although it's slightly different between 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, a turn
                    usually consists of 4 phases: A hero phases where you can casts spells and leaders can perform special commands and abilities, this is then followed by a movement phase. Once
                    you've moved everything where you want it to go, the shooting phase is next and then the final phase is a combat phase where you can charge your units into melee combat. Once
                    the combat phase has ended, it's then other players turn and this will go on for 7 turns at most and then the game will end. During the game, their will be objectives on the board 
                    for you take and personal objectives you take at the start of the game as well, such as killing the enemy leader or hunting down the enemies big monsters or vehicles. These objectives
                    earn you points and the winner of the game is decided by whoeveer has the most points by the end of the game. Although there is more nuance to the game and differences to 
                    WH 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, that is general gist of how a normal game of Warhammer will play out. 
                </p>
                <h3>The different settings</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, there are two different settings for Warhammer: Warhammer 40,000 is set in the far distant and very grim future whilst Age of Sigmar, although
                    still quite dark in places, is a more typical fantasy setting. As mentioned previously these different settings, although quite similar in parts, have different rules 
                    and different factions in them as well. The main theme of these two settings is the Forces of Order against the Forces of Chaos; Humanity and their allies fighting against
                    cultists, demons and their evil gods. Some factions fall outside of Order and Chaos, such as Orks as they just want to fight anything, however that is the main focus of the two settings
                    with humanity represented in different ways. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first got into the hobby by playing Warhammer 40,000. This was due to Warhammer fantasy, the fantasy setting before Age of Sigmar, was quite daunting to get in to;
                    most of the armies had a lot of models in them, around 100-200 models for each decent army, which was expensive and very time consuming to paint them all. However Warhammer 40,000 most their armies
                    had a much lower entry of play; You needed less models to field a decent army which in turn was cheaper to buy and required less time to build and paint them. Age of Sigmar
                    nowadays allows you get into the hobby quite easily which I myself have now started playing as I am now getting back into the hobby. Although mentioned above the settings and their rules hold a fair few 
                    similarities, there is enough variety and difference between for anyone who wants to get in to the hobby.

                <h3>What is Warhammer 40,000?</h3>
                <p>As mentioned above, Warhammer 40,000 is set in a very distant and dark future: the galaxy is engulfed in a war that has been going on thousands of years with 
                    humanity at the center of it due to their rapid and aggresive expansion. There are a plethora of factions within this universe: humanity, the Imperium, is incredibly religiously zealous and 
                    xenophobic, killing anyone or anything that doesn't share their ideals or shows even the smallest sign of turning to chaos. The armies of the imperium is split into several further factions: 
                    The Imperial guard who are the normal, human soldiers of the imperium and the Adeptus Astartes who are genetically enhanced and elite soldiers clad in power armour. There are 
                    smaller sub-factions to these as well, such as the Inquisition who focus on discovering and clearing out chaos and xenos cults in the imperium, there are also a group who focus on 
                    exterminating demons known as the Grey Knights. The imperium is a very vast empire that has spread itself too thin across the galaxy and is breaking under it's own weight, unable to 
                    sustain itself due to it's size and all its enemies.

                <h3>Enemies of the Imperium</h3>
                <p>
                The Imperium has many enemies within this setting, sometimes they work along side other races if the need arises however they are otherwise incredibly xenophobic and hostile
                to alien races. These alien races consist of the Eldar who are a very advanced but arrogant race on the brink of extinction and the Dark Eldar who are space pirates who 
                commit depraved acts to appease their god otherwise they can lose their souls. The Necrons are a cold and robotic race who's main goal is to regain their physical bodies and free
                will. There are Orks who love fighting humans so will regularly crash land their ships onto human worlds in order fight or die trying whilst the Tau are an asian inspired race
                who are naive but try to spread their message of what they call the "greater good". And finally there are the Tyranids, an insect like race who are controlled by a hive mind 
                and only wish to devour everything in their path.

                <h3>Chaos and their Gods</h3>
                <p>
                The most prevalent enemy in the universe to most if not all of the races in Warhammer 40,000 is Chaos; Four gods reside in a hellish landscape called The Warp,
                a realm just beyond on our own where they and their respective demons reside. These four gods are akin to the four horseman of the apocalypse: Khorne is a god of
                war and bloodshed, Tzeentch is a god of change and schemes, Slaanesh is a god of pleasure and Nurgle is a god of rot and decay. Although they themselves don't hold a
                physical presence in our realm, they slowly tempt and corrupt people to join their cause. Those that seek strength and battle will seek out Khorne whilst 
                those who seek out knowledge may commune with Tzeentch. Slaanesh offers heightened pleasures whilst Nurgle can grants his followers immortality and freedom from 
                pain. The pacts people make with these gods however are very slippery slopes, such as having to regularly commit grandeous acts of violence in order to appease them
                or risk having their own bodies twisted and mutated as punishment. Their followers are willing to go to these lengths however to receive greater boons and rewards from them.
                As well as their fanatical followers, Chaos also hosts demons representative of the four gods who spill out of The Warp when a tear opens between it and our realm. These forces 
                slowly chip away at the imperium and the other races in hopes to one day bring them all to heel and for anarchy and chaos to rule the galaxy instead.

                <h3>What is Warhammer: Age of Sigmar?</h3>
                <p>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar is a continuation of sorts from a previous Warhammer game system, Warhammer fantasy: The world of Warhammer fantasy was lost to 
                    the daemons of Chaos. In an attenpt to survive, the God-King of mankind, Sigmar, and other humans and allies fled to the heavenly realm of Azyr and closed its 
                    gates whilst Chaos ran rampant throughout the world in their Age of Chaos. During this time, the world outside of Azyr became hell for its inhabitants, turning to 
                    Chaos simply as a means of survival and it remained that way for 500 years. Eventually, the gates to Azyr reopened and out came the forces of Sigmar, 
                    The Stormcast Eternals; Heroes from mankind who have had their souls reforged to be gifted with god like powers and are able to be remade in Azyr if they were 
                    fall in battle. These reforged heroes set out across the other realms in order to strike back at Chaos and thus began the Age of Sigmar.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Grand Alliance of Order</h3>
                <p>There are four Grand Alliances in the setting of Age of Sigmar: Order, Death, Destruction and Chaos. 
                    The Stormcast Eternals are part of the Grand Alliance of Order and work alongside other humans as well who weren't reforged in Azyr. 
                    These humans are apart of the Cities of Sigmar; Cities that were made once the Stormcast Eternals made a foothold on the realms outside of Azyr. 
                    These Cities of Sigmar are comprised of normal humans as well as dwarves and elves who band together to fight And defend themselves when the Stormcast 
                    cannot. Some Dwarves and Elves also managed to survive the Age of Chaos and were reforged similar to the Stormcast in their own way; Some dwarves 
                    became infused with the power of fire and became Fyreslayers, dwarves who make oaths to seek out a glorious death in combat. 
                    Some elves became Lords of Lumineth or a part of Sylvaneth; Elves that became powerful wizards or in touch with nature respectively. 
                    Outside of these more stereotypical fantasy races are the Lizardmen, also known as Seraphon: They are an Aztec inspired race who fight 
                    alongside great dinosaurs who work to keep the balance of the realms in order and stem the tide of chaos, less focused on smaller battles and work 
                    towards much grander goals of peace, coming across as aloof in the process.</p>

                <h3>The Grand Alliance of Death</h3>
                <p>So whereas the forces of Order are more or less the "good guys" of the setting, the Grand Alliance of Death, and Destruction to a lesser extent, are 
                    more morally grey and they are mostly self serving rather than simply creating anarchy like Chaos. They all follow the God of Death, Nagash, who wants 
                    to impose his own rule over the realms, rather than rule equally like Order. His forces consist of the Soulblight Gravelords: 
                    Vampires who command undead hordes, skeletons, knights and even undead dragons to do their bidding. The forces of Nighthaunt and Flesh-Eater courts 
                    are more monstrous in nature; they are made up of ethereal creatures and ghoulish monsters respectively. Finally, there are the Ossiarch 
                    Bonereapers who are an egyptian inspired race who use a mixture of skeleton warriors, artilery equipment and great constructs to wage war with.</p>

        <div class="left-about">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Grand Alliance of Destruction</h3>
                <p>Order seeks to rule fairly, Death seeks to rule as a single leader but destruction simply wants that; to fight and start wars. It's rather simple minded, 
                    no grand strategy or schemes just simply wanting to have the biggest, greatest fight they can have. The Grand Alliance of Destruction is made up of four 
                    factions; The Orruk Warclans are ork like creatures, simply wanting to fight in close combat as fast as they can with help from shaman magic. The Sons of
                    Behemat are a monstrous force, made up solely of giants and are a more slow, lumbering force compared to the speed of the Orruk. The Ogor Mawtribes lie somewhere 
                    in the middle, a race of ogres who, although simple-minded as well, employ designs and technology stolen from humans and dwarves such as gunpowder weapons and chariots. 
                    Finally, there are the Gloomspire Gitz, a race of goblinoids who, unlike their counterparts, are rather devious and cunning; prefer to ambush their targets rather than a head-on 
                    fight. These goblins also tame spiders to fight with, riding them into battle like cavalry with some these gargantuan spiders being a similar size to a house. Although they 
                    all go about it in their own yet similar way, these four factions all simply want destruction and ruin with no real, long term goal beyond that.

                <h3>The Grand Alliance of Chaos</h3>
                <p>Chaos in Age of Sigmar is mostly similar to it's 40,000 counterpart; Cultists and Demons working together to provide tribute to their respective gods. However, 
                    there are more races at play within Age of Sigmar that side with Chaos beyond just humans and demons. There are also the Beasts of Chaos, creatures tainted and mutated 
                    by the power of Chaos into something between man and beast. These range from stereotypical mythical creatures like Centaurs and Minotaurs to more grotesque creatures called Spawn, 
                    a bloated, twisted mess of flesh, horns and tentacles that are simply pointed in a direction as they can't think for themselves anymore. These beasts rely on powerful hit and run 
                    tactics whereas the other chaos race, Skaven, rely on machines and magics. They are a race of humanoid rats that by themselves are cowardly but they are very great in number, sometimes referred to
                    as the Vermintide. A large portion of their strength however comes from their machines; great cannons that can fire lightning to small weapons teams that use 
                    flamethrowers and miniguns. Their magics allow them to spread great plagues as well, some of the rats becoming fanatical in their beliefs of this pestilent magic. 
                    The mission for chaos remains the same, regardless of the faction or race; to spread anarachy and chaos throughout the realms to appease their dark gods.
