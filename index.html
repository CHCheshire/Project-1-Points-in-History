        <h1>What is Warhammer?</h1>
        <div id="what-is-left">
            <div class="intro">
                <h4>What is it and why do people play?</h4>
                <p>Warhammer has several different settings, one based in a very far but very grim future and another based in a more fantasy style universe however both play
                    in a similar way; they are both turn-based tabletop strategy games. A game lasts usually six turns and those turns are split up into several phases where you can do certain actions 
                    based on the phase and units in your army. It's something I got into as a teenager and played for about 4 years but stopped when I went to college however I've now started to get back into the hobby again. 
                    I made a lot of friends from when I played and have a lot of good memories from it as well.  </p>
            
            
                <h4>How it's played</h4>
                <p>Warhammer, in either of its systems, follows similar rules to how it's played: You will chose your faction and build an army from that
                    and then you will play the game itself in turns that themselves are split up into phases. So lets look at from the point of view of someone who is just 
                    starting to get into Warhammer 40,000 and wants to build an army, they want to pick a faction that suits their playstyle. One of the reasons that I'm such a big 
                    fan of the game is that you can play in any way you want. Do you want a small, elite force or more of a horde army? Do you want a long ranged army or one that wants
                    to get up close? Do you want a more magic based army or even one designed to counter magic? There a lots of different ways to play and, although some excel more in areas
                    than others, any faction can be played any way, it's simply up to you as a player as to what you want. </p>
                <p> So now that this person has decided on their army, how is the game itself played? You and the other player will set up your armies on either side of the board you're playing on,
                    usually a 6x4 foot map with players set up on opposite long edges of the board. Then you deploy your armies on your respective side and flip a coin to see who goes first. 
                    Whoever wins the toss gets to choose who goes first and then that player will take their first turn. Although it's slightly different between 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, a turn
                    usually consists of 4 phases: A hero phases where you can casts spells and leaders can perform special commands and abilities, this is then followed by a movement phase. Once
                    you've moved everything where you want it to go, the shooting phase is next and then the final phase is a combat phase where you can charge your units into melee combat. Once
                    the combat phase has ended, it's then other players turn and this will go on for 7 turns at most and then the game will end. During the game, their will be objectives on the board 
                    for you take and personal objectives you take at the start of the game as well, such as killing the enemy leader or hunting down the enemies big monsters or vehicles. These objectives
                    earn you points and the winner of the game is decided by whoeveer has the most points by the end of the game. Although there is more nuance to the game and differences to 
                    WH 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, that is general gist of how a normal game of Warhammer will play out. 
                </p>
            
            
                <h4>The different settings</h4>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, there are two different settings for Warhammer: Warhammer 40,000 is set in the far distant and very grim future whilst Age of Sigmar, although
                    still quite dark in places, is a more typical fantasy setting. As mentioned previously these different settings, although quite similar in parts, have different rules 
                    and different factions in them as well. The main theme of these two settings is the Forces of Order against the Forces of Chaos; Humanity and their allies fighting against
                    cultists, demons and their evil gods. Some factions fall outside of Order and Chaos, such as Orks as they just want to fight anything, however that is the main focus of the two settings
                    with humanity represented in different ways. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first got into the hobby by playing Warhammer 40,000. This was due to Warhammer fantasy, the fantasy setting before Age of Sigmar, was quite daunting to get in to;
                    most of the armies had a lot of models in them, around 100-200 models for each decent army, which was expensive and very time consuming to paint them all. However Warhammer 40,000 most their armies
                    had a much lower entry of play; You needed less models to field a decent army which in turn was cheaper to buy and required less time to build and paint them. Age of Sigmar
                    nowadays allows you get into the hobby quite easily which I myself have now started playing as I am now getting back into the hobby. Although mentioned above the settings and their rules hold a fair few 
                    similarities, there is enough variety and difference between for anyone who wants to get in to the hobby.
